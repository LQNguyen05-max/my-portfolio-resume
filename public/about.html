<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, I'm Le Quang Nguyen, also known as Leo Nguyen, currently pursuing a Computer Science major at the 
  the University of Texas at Dallas. My passion lies in technology, programming, and gaming. Having to transitioned 
  from a former Fortnite Pro player and having the dedication of putting 10 hours a day in League Of Legends, I'm driven
  to built a bridge between gaming and programming. I aim to inspire fellow gamers who had face denials, phonophobia,
  or inadequate to anything in life. If this is listed any of you, well I'm your guy! 

<p>With my current focus on Computer Science, I aspire to utilize my skills to change the industry. My journey from competitive gaming
  has brought upon me that I could create a unique perspective on user experience and interface designs. Through programming,
  I seek to develop tools and platforms to interchange the gameplay and connectivity to make adaptations within the gaming commodities.
</p>

<p>Outside of my academic and gaming institute, I enjoyed playing TFT and spending time with friends. As a programmer, taking breaks is
  the key to help refreshen one's mind after sitting countless hour on a complex, discrete problem.
</p>

<p>And that's pretty much you need to know about me.

  Thank you for reading my background!</p>
